# EscapeGameJS

a school project escape game

Actual name: Escape from the Olomouc Region

# NOTES
This is my first real attempt at doing anything in JS so the code is quite janky in places and the packaging system... let's say that a shell script which works only on Linux (and Mac maybe?) is suboptimal at best. It does work and doesn't use any deprecated or vendor-specific functions (so success, kinda) but there is heavy pollution of the global namespace. (random variables)

# Easter eggs
There are some, but try to find them by yourself :)

If you cant:
<details> 
  <summary>List of easter eggs (SPOILERS!)</summary>
    The cook says "Im gonna let you cook" - reference to Breaking Bad<br>
	Přerov has artillery - reference to the crime rate of the actual city of Přerov, Czech Republic<br>
</details>

# Issues
If you encounter issues, please email them to megapolispl@outlook.com and I will try to get back to you.

Purple screen means loading, that is not an issue most of the time.
