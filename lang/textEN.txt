It is the 1st of May 1997 and the Slovak minority has just
declared independence from the young republic of Czechia.
With the support of the Slovak Republic the separatists are
now pushing deep into the Moravian heartlands. They have
also poisoned the Beƒçva river along the way and are now
standing just a few kilometers away from Hranice.
It is time to escape.
