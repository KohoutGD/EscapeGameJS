Backstory
Day

The difficulty determines not only the above values, but also the
difficulty of the minigames. The difficulty or the language cannot
be changed during the game. All values will be saved.

It is the 1st of May 1997 and the Slovak minority has just
declared independence from the young republic of Czechia.
With the support of the Slovak Republic the separatists are
now pushing deep into the Moravian heartlands. They have
also contaminated the Bečva river along the way and are
now standing just a few kilometers away from Hranice.
It is time to escape.

Back

Yet another wonderful day.
Let's read the news!
Crap. The Slovaks have rebeled and they are just a few
kilometers away from Hranice!
How is this possible? The Czechs will start conscription
soon!
I must escape! But where do I go? I think Poland might be
a safe bet and it's the easiest option out there.
It's not like I have a choice anyway - Germany is too far
away and too expensive and Austria is not much better.
Poland it is then!

I'm free at any time.

So you want to buy a ticket, right?
To go to Přerov it would cost 
If you want to buy a ticket be quick, there are a lot people
like you who want to escape.
So do you want to buy the ticket?
Ok, here you go!
Wait, that's not enough you thief!
Get out of here!
Okay, see you later!

Hey! Buy a ticket first!
Hey! You already have a ticket, don't you?

Welcome to Přerov. Sadly, the track to Olomouc is
closed. Let's hope that the SŽDC will get it together
You will have to go through a few cities
to get to Olomouc.
Due to inflation the tickets rose in price significantly.
The tickets to Nezamyslice cost 
Also the city has quite a criminal history,
so good luck and leave as soon as possible.
Good luck!

So you want to buy a ticket again?
The cost of the ticket to Nezamyslice is 
So do you want to buy the ticket?
Ok, here you go.
Hey, stop bothering me if you don't have enough money.
Ok, hopefully you change you mind.

Welcome to Nezamyslice. This is a small village and
a very important railway junction. 
You have to change here onto the train to Prostějov and
later Olomouc, Ostrava and Poland etc.
The city is also not as criminal as Přerov
but the Slovaks are closing in on the city so...
The tickets to Prostějov cost 

Are you going to Prostějov now?
If the answer and yes than you will have to pay 
So do you want to buy the tickets?
(I expect a yes since you seem to be travelling a lot...)
Ok, here is the ticket.
If you want to buy a ticket bring enough money next time.
Ok, hopefully you will rethink this.

Welcome to Prostějov. This is an actual city and not some
random village in the countryside. It's also quite nice.
It's also quite far away from the front lines, so you can
relax a bit and it is probably the safest place so far.
Tickets to Olomouc cost approximately 
if you are going to need them.
Good luck!

Oh time for Olomouc I see... The cost is 
Okay do you have enough money and, more importantly,
do you want to buy the ticket?
Okay, hop on!
Hey, you promised me something!
Okay, as nice as Prostějov is it is not the best place
to be at this point in time.

Welcome to Olomouc, the home of cheesemaking and also the
first city on our trip with a functioning tram system!
There is quite a lot of stuff to do but still, I wouldn`t
stay here I were you.
The tickets to Katowice cost 

Okay so are we going to Poland?
The ticket to Katowice costs 
I'm sure nothing will ever happen along the way - I mean we
aren`t going through any known places...
Okay so are we actually going to Poland?
It seems that the answer is indeed yes!
You don`t have money again???
Okay, try some cheeses and return!

Why are we braking and honking?
Oh crap!
We almost hit a steamroller on a crossing. Crap.
Also why do I hear artillery and the Slovak anthem?

I should probably help defend the village first...

Hopefully nothing happens this time!

And now to transfer to the right train!

Finally in Poland!
Yay!

Hi, I need to quickly go to a place due to personal reasons
but my superiors have forbidden me to leave the workplace.
Would you mind covering me? I can offer you 300 CZK.
Oh, thank you very much!
Ok, I can't really be mad at you, I guess.

Good day sir, would you mind helping me decipher some text?
It's written in a weird local dialect and since you live
here you might be more familiar with it than me.
Would you mind helping?
Thank you for saving me a lot of hassle.
Ok, I'm going to have to ask someone else.

Hi, could you help me clean some benches?
I could pay you 400 CZK.
Deal?
Thanks!
Ok, fair enough.

Hi, would you like to help us manufacture some cheese?
It's not too difficult and you get a lot of money, I swear!
Let's go!
Oh, ok.

Oh, you want to help defend the village?
Great!
One of our 2 batalions just got called back and we need someone
to fill our ranks. Will you help your countrymen?
Let's get to work!
Coward! Come back ASAP!
