It is the 1st of May 1997 and the Slovak minority has just
declared independence from the young republic of Czechia.
With the support of the Slovak Republic the separatists are
now pushing deep into the Moravian heartlands. They have
also contaminated the Bečva river along the way and are
now standing just a few kilometers away from Hranice.
It is time to escape.

Back

Yet another wonderful day.
Let's read the news!
Crap. The Slovaks have rebeled and they are just a few
kilometers away from Hranice!
How is this possible? The Czechs will start conscription
soon!
I must escape! But where do I go? I think Poland might be
a safe bet and it's the easiest option out there.
It's not like I have a choice anyway - Germany is too far
away and too expensive and Austria is not much better.
Poland it is then!

Our waiter just left us. 
Will you help me deliver the food to the tables?

Do you agree?
Ok, let's go!
If you change your mind you can return.
I'm free at any time.
